This is a working application, but it's not ready to use. If you're curious about what we're building, feel free to ask questions or pitch in and help us make a better generator system for node.js.

## Project goals

> The goal of this project is to offer an alternative to Yeoman that is:

+ easier to use, and easier to author generators
+ faster and lighter 
+ should be composable and modular, allowing you to reuse logic across generators for things like:
  - tasks
  - plugins
  - middleware
  - loaders
  - templates
  - helpers
  - data

## TODO

- [x] resolving global generators
- [x] loading global generators
- [x] path handling for generators
- [x] path handling for templates
- [x] template processing
- [x] data loading (for templates)
- [x] path handling for cwd
- [ ] prompts
- [ ] collision management
