## Getting started 

### Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `generate` globally using [npm][], along with any generators you'd like to run.

**Install Generate**

{%= include("install-global") %}

**Install a generator**

If you aren't familiar with generate, just take the `node` generator for a test drive:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate-node
```

### Run a generator

If everything installed correctly, you should now be able to generate a new project with the following command (make sure you run the command from an empty directory!):

```sh
$ gen node
```

## Usage
{%= docs('usage') %}

### Run sub-generators

> Sub-generators are normal generators that are called from (or registered by) other generators.

Dot-notation is used for getting and runing sub-generators. 

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name> [options]
```

**Examples**

Run sub-generator `b` on generator `a`:

```sh
$ gen a.b [options]
```

Run sub-generator `c`:

```sh
$ gen a.b.c [options]
```

And so on...


### Run a generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `bar` on generator `foo`.

```sh
$ gen foo:bar 
```

### Run a sub-generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `foo` on sub.generator `a.b.c`.

```sh
$ gen a.b.c:foo 
```

## Authoring generators

_(TODO)_

### Generator naming conventions

**Do**

Use `generate-` as the prefix, followed by any words of your choosing to describe the purpose of the generator.

**Don't**

Use `generator-` as the prefix, since the word `generator` is already associated with yeoman.

## TODO

- [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project generator with a user-friendly and expressive API
- [x] support sub-generators (to any level of nesting)
- [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp][] and [assemble][assemble-core]
- [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI 
- [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to generate
- [x] support any template engine
- [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
- [x] support templates as [vinyl][] files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
- [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc) 
- [x] 820+ unit tests
- [ ] create and publish generators (we created a handful of generators that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
- [ ] CLI docs (started)
- [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `gen help` or just `gen`)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] Generator guidelines and conventions
