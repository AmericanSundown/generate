**TODO**

- [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project generator with a user-friendly and expressive API
- [x] support sub-generators (to any level of nesting)
- [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp][] and [assemble][assemble-core]
- [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI 
- [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to generate
- [x] support any template engine
- [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
- [x] support templates as [vinyl][] files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
- [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc) 
- [x] 820+ unit tests
- [ ] create and publish generators (we created a handful of generators that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
- [ ] CLI docs (started)
- [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `gen help` or just `gen`)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] Generator guidelines and conventions

## Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `generate` globally using [npm][], along with any generators you'd like to run.

**Install generate**

## Install

{%= include("install-global") %}

**Install a generator**

If you aren't familiar with generate, just take the `node` generator for a test drive:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate-node
```

**Run a generator**

If everything installed correctly, you should now be able to generate a new project with the following command (make sure you run the command from an empty directory!):

```sh
$ gen node
```

***

## Usage

```sh
$ gen <command> [args]
```

## CLI

_(WIP)_

### help

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate. 

```js
$ gen help
```

### init

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate. 

```js
$ gen init
```

Upon running `init`, generate will prompt you for answers to the following questions:


### Run generators

```sh
$ gen <generator name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run generator `abc`

```sh
$ gen abc
```

### Run tasks

To run a task on the `base` generator, just pass the name of the task to run.

```sh
$ gen <task name> [options]
```

Unless overridden by the user, the `base` generator is the default generator that ships with Generate. This generator doesn't really "generate" anything, but it will prompt you for a few answers (if you choose), to store data that's commonly needed by templates, like `author.name`, GitHub `username`, etc. 

**Example**

Run task `bar`:

```sh
$ gen bar
```

### Run sub-generators

> Sub-generators are normal generators that are called from (or registered by) other generators.

Dot-notation is used for getting and runing sub-generators. 

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name> [options]
```

**Examples**

Run sub-generator `b` on generator `a`:

```sh
$ gen a.b [options]
```

Run sub-generator `c`:

```sh
$ gen a.b.c [options]
```

And so on...


### Run a generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `bar` on generator `foo`.

```sh
$ gen foo:bar 
```

### Run a sub-generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `foo` on sub.generator `a.b.c`.

```sh
$ gen a.b.c:foo 
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

### .getConfig

Static method for getting the very first instance to be used as the `base` instance. The first instance will either be defined by the user, like in local `node_modules`, or a globally installed module that serves as a default/fallback.

**Params**

* `filename` **{String}**: Then name of the config file to lookup.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the "base" instance.

**Example**

```js
var base = Generate.getConfig('generator.js');
```

### .getTask

Get task `name` from the `generate.tasks` object.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**
* `returns` **{Object}**

**Example**

```js
generate.getTask('abc');

// get a task from generator `foo`
generate.getTask('foo:abc');

// get a task from sub-generator `foo.bar`
generate.getTask('foo.bar:abc');
```

### .addGenerator

Alias for `register`. Adds a `generator` with the given `name` to the `generate.generators` object.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: The name of the config object to register
* `config` **{Object|Function}**: The config object or function

**Example**

```js
base.addGenerator('foo', function(app, base, env) {
  // `app` is a `Generate` instance created for the generator
  // `base` is a "shared" instance that provides access to all loaded generators
  // `env` is a configuration/environment object with details about the generator,
  // user cwd, etc
});
```

### .hasGenerator

Return true if generator `name` is registered. Dot-notation may be used to check for [sub-generators](#sub-generators).

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**
* `returns` **{Boolean}**

**Example**

```js
base.hasGenerator('foo.bar.baz');
```

### .getGenerator

Return generator `name` is registered. Dot-notation may be used to get [sub-generators](#sub-generators).

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**
* `returns` **{Boolean}**

**Example**

```js
base.getGenerator('foo');
// or
base.getGenerator('foo.bar.baz');
```

### .extendGenerator

Extend an generator.

**Params**

* `generator` **{Object}**
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the instance for chaining.

**Example**

```js
var foo = base.getGenerator('foo');
foo.extendGenerator(generator);
```

### .invoke

Invoke generator `fn` with the given `base` instance.

**Params**

* `fn` **{Function}**: The generator function.
* `generator` **{Object}**: The "base" instance to use with the generator.
* `returns` **{Object}**

**Example**

```js
generate.invoke(generator.fn, generator);
```

## Authoring generators

_(TODO)_

### Generator naming conventions

**Do**

Use `generate-` as the prefix, followed by any words of your choosing to describe the purpose of the generator.

**Don't**

Use `generator-` as the prefix, since the word `generator` is already associated with yeoman.
