## What is generate?

Generate is a CLI and API for creating new code projects from templates, scaffolds and boilerplates. 

## Quickstart

**Installing the CLI**

To run generate from the command line, you'll need to install the module globally first. You can that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory. 



## Running tasks and generators

**Running a generator**

Once installed successfully, you should be able to run generate using the `gen` command. 


To run a **sub-generator** on the `defaults` generator:

```sh
# note the ".", where "foo" is a sub-generator
$ gen defaults.foo
```

To run a **task** on the `defaults` generator:

```sh
# note the ":", where "bar" is a task
$ gen defaults:bar
```

Or to run a **task on a sub-generator** of the `defaults` generator:

```sh
# note the "." and ":", where "foo:bar" is the "bar" task on the "foo" sub-generator
$ gen defaults.foo:bar
```

```
{%= tree(10) %}
```


Generate is built on [base][], a powerful and expressive framework for building node.js applications.
