## What is a scaffold?

In a nutshell, a scaffold is just a declarative configuration that defines, amongst other things:

- glob patterns or paths to source files
- destionation paths
- options (which can include a plugin pipeline and various other options)

See the [scaffold][] library for more information about scaffolds, features and options.
