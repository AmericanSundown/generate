# Middleware guidelines

Guidelines for authoring durable, reliable middleware:

* middleware should do one thing, and do it well
* middleware should self-encapsulated, and should not rely on other middleware or plugins whenever possible
* middleware should be able to run before or after any other middleware called by the same handler. For example, if two different `.onLoad` middleware are registered, either should be able to run first or last, without effecting the results of either middleware.
