## Why Generate?

- First and foremost, because we (as a community) can do better than the current dominant solutions. JavasScript has come a long way in the past few years, but we still have a long way to go to

## Why trust our conventions?

Generate is brought to you by the creators of [Assemble][], [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) and [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb). Together, Jon and Brian have published more than 1,000 software projects, that were collectively downloaded more than 1 billion downloads in 2015.

- We wanted to see a faster, lighter project generator. Must faster and less bloated than the alternatives


## Why use Generate?

Most importantly, generate is built on top of great libraries like [assemble-core][], [bach][] and [composer][],


## Advantages over Yeoman

- Generate is noticably faster than Yeoman, (Yeoman can take more than 1 second just to load!) during initialization and when generating files. Of course, either project will slow down as more generators are installed on your system.


**Commands**

Since both [tasks][] and [generators][] Generate only has a few blessed _commands_
