### Run a generator

**Install a generator**

If you aren't familiar with generate, just take the `node` generator for a test drive:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate-node
```

If everything installed correctly, you should now be able to generate a new project with the following command (make sure you run the command from an empty directory!):

```sh
$ gen node
```
