## What is generate?

Generate is a new, open source developer framework built on node.js for rapidly initializing and scaffolding out new code projects, with an intuitive CLI, and a powerful and expressive API that makes it easy to learn, and enjoyable to use.

Generate may be installed globally and run with the `gen` command, or installed locally and used as a libary within your own application.

## Feature highlights

Generate offers an elegant and robust suite of methods, carefully organized to help you accomplish more in less time, including:

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [generators](#generators) and [tasks](#tasks)

* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: generate a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) and [pug](http://jade-lang.com)
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins
* **smart plugins**: Generate is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.

Or continue on, and start generating!

## Quickstart

### CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run generate from the command line, you'll need to install it globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

You should now be able to use the `gen` command to execute code in a local `generator.js` file, or to execute globally installed generators by their [aliases](#generator-aliases).

**CLI Cheatsheet**

```
Usage: gen <command> [options]

Command: Generator or tasks to run

Examples:

  # run the "foo" generator
  $ gen foo

  # run the "bar" task on generator "foo"
  $ gen foo:bar

  # run multiple tasks on generator "foo"
  $ gen foo:bar,baz,qux

  # run a sub-generator on generator "foo"
  $ gen foo.abc

  # run task "xyz" on sub-generator "foo.abc"
  $ gen foo.abc:xyz

  # run multiple generators, sub-generators, or tasks
  $ gen foo foo.abc foo:bar

  Generate attempts to automatically determine if "foo" is a task or generator.
  If there is a conflict, you can force generate to run generator "foo"
  by specifying a task on the generator. Example: `gen foo:default`
```

### Usage

The following intro only skims the surface of what generate has to offer. For a more in-depth introduction, we highly recommend visiting the [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started).

<a name="generators"></a>

**Create a generator**

Add a `generator.js` to the current working directory with the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  console.log('success!');
};
```

**Run a generator**

Enter the following command:

```sh
gen
```

If successful, you should see `success!` in the terminal.

<a name="tasks"></a>

**Create a task**

Now, add a task to your generator.

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    console.log('success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

Now, in the command line, run:

```sh
$ gen
# then try
$ gen default
```

When a local `generator.js` exists, the `gen` command is aliased to automatically run the `default` task if one exists. But you can also run the task with `gen default`.

**Run a task**

Let's try adding more tasks to your generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    console.log('default > success!');
    cb();
  });
  
  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    console.log('foo > success!');
    cb();
  });

  app.task('bar', function(cb) {
    console.log('bar > success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

Now, in the command line, run:

```sh
$ gen
# then try
$ gen foo
# then try
$ gen foo bar
```

**Run task dependencies**

Now update your code to the following:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', ['foo', 'bar']);
  
  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    console.log('foo > success!');
    cb();
  });

  app.task('bar', function(cb) {
    console.log('bar > success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

And run:

```sh
$ gen
```

You're now a master at running tasks with generate! You can do anything with generate tasks that you can do with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks (we use and support gulp libraries after all!).

**Next steps**

But generate does much more than this. For a more in-depth introduction, we highly recommend visiting the [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started).

## FAQ

<a name="aliases"></a>

### Generator aliases

**What's a "generator alias"?**

A generator's alias is created by stripping the substring `generate-` from the _full name_ of generator.

**What are they used for?**

Generate tries to find globally installed generators using an "alias" first, falling back on the generator's full name if not found by its alias. Thus, when publishing a generator the naming convention `generate-foo` should be used (where `foo` is the alias, and `generate-foo` is the full name).

**Alias conventions**

No dots may be used in published generator names. Aside from that, any characters considered valid by npm are fine.

### Task aliases

Task aliases are just tasks that only exist to reference another task or tasks.

**Example**

Here, the `default` task is an alias for the `foo` task.

```js
app.task('foo', function() {});
app.task('default', ['foo']);
```

**Why use aliases?**

Typically aliases are used as as a convenience to make it easier to call multiple tasks. For example:

```js
app.task('foo', function() {});
app.task('bar', function() {});
app.task('default', ['foo', 'bar']);
```

See the [Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/generate/best-practices/naming-tasks) for advice on naming tasks.
