## Getting started

### Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `generate` globally using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/), along with any generators you'd like to run.

**Install Generate**

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

**Install a generator**

If you aren't familiar with generate, just take the `node` generator for a test drive:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate-node
```

### Run a generator

If everything installed correctly, you should now be able to generate a new project with the following command (make sure you run the command from an empty directory!):

```sh
$ gen node
```

***

## Usage

```sh
$ gen <command> [args]
```

## CLI

_(WIP)_

### help

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate.

```js
$ gen help
```

### init

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate.

```js
$ gen init
```

Upon running `init`, generate will prompt you for answers to the following questions:

### Run generators

```sh
$ gen <generator name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run generator `abc`

```sh
$ gen abc
```

### Run tasks

To run a task on the `base` generator, just pass the name of the task to run.

```sh
$ gen <task name> [options]
```

Unless overridden by the user, the `base` generator is the default generator that ships with Generate. This generator doesn't really "generate" anything, but it will prompt you for a few answers (if you choose), to store data that's commonly needed by templates, like `author.name`, GitHub `username`, etc.

**Example**

Run task `bar`:

```sh
$ gen bar
```

### Run sub-generators

> Sub-generators are normal generators that are called from (or registered by) other generators.

Dot-notation is used for getting and runing sub-generators.

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name> [options]
```

**Examples**

Run sub-generator `b` on generator `a`:

```sh
$ gen a.b [options]
```

Run sub-generator `c`:

```sh
$ gen a.b.c [options]
```

And so on...

### Run a generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `bar` on generator `foo`.

```sh
$ gen foo:bar 
```

### Run a sub-generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `foo` on sub.generator `a.b.c`.

```sh
$ gen a.b.c:foo 
```

## API

### [Generate](index.js#L23)

Create an instance of `Generate` with the given `options`

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: Configuration options to initialize with.

**Example**

```js
var Generate = require('generate');
var generate = new Generate(options);
```

### [.process](index.js#L148)

Similar to [copy](#copy) but calls a plugin `pipeline` if passed on the `options`. This allows plugin pipelines to be programmatically built-up and dynamically changed on-the-fly.

**Params**

* `files` **{Object}**
* `options` **{Object}**
* `cb` **{Function}**
* `returns` **{Stream}**: Returns a [vinyl](http://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) src stream

**Example**

```js
generate.process({src: ['a.txt', 'b.txt']}, options);
```

### [.each](index.js#L168)

Generate `files` configurations in parallel.

**Params**

* `config` **{Object}**
* `cb` **{Function}**

**Example**

```js
generate.each(files, function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});
```

### [.eachSeries](index.js#L191)

Generate `files` configurations in series.

**Params**

* `config` **{Object}**
* `cb` **{Function}**

**Example**

```js
generate.eachSeries(files, function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});
```

### [.scaffold](index.js#L223)

Generate files from a declarative [scaffold](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/scaffold) configuration.

**Params**

* `scaffold` **{Object}**: Scaffold configuration
* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function

**Example**

```js
var Scaffold = require('scaffold');
var scaffold = new Scaffold({
  options: {cwd: 'source'},
  posts: {
    src: ['content/*.md']
  },
  pages: {
    src: ['templates/*.hbs']
  }
});

generate.scaffold(scaffold, function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});
```

## Authoring generators

_(TODO)_

### Generator naming conventions

**Do**

Use `generate-` as the prefix, followed by any words of your choosing to describe the purpose of the generator.

**Don't**

Use `generator-` as the prefix, since the word `generator` is already associated with yeoman.

## TODO

* [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project generator with a user-friendly and expressive API
* [x] support sub-generators (to any level of nesting)
* [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core)
* [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI
* [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to generate
* [x] support any template engine
* [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
* [x] support templates as [vinyl](http://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
* [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc)
* [x] 820+ unit tests
* [ ] create and publish generators (we created a handful of generators that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
* [ ] CLI docs (started)
* [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `gen help` or just `gen`)
* [ ] API docs
* [ ] Generator guidelines and conventions
