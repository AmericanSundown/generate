# generate [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generate.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generate)

> Project generator, for node.js.

**Goals**

The goal of this project is to offer an alternative to Yeoman that is:

+ easier to use, and easier to author generators
+ faster and lighter (yeoman takes forever to load!)
+ should be composable and modular, allowing you to reuse logic across generators for things like:
  - tasks
  - plugins
  - middleware
  - loaders
  - templates
  - helpers
  - data
